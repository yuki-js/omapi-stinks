         CRITICAL: DO NOT add payment/banking apps with strict security to scope!
         Adding payment apps (Google Pay, Rakuten Pay, etc.) can trigger root detection
         and cause them to stop working.
         
         REQUIRED for functionality:
         - android (Android Framework - contains OMAPI implementation)
         - com.android.se (SecureElement system service)
         
         The module monitors OMAPI calls at the SYSTEM LEVEL, so you can see activity
         from ALL apps without directly hooking them. Only hook specific apps if you
         need detailed debugging and they don't have strict security checks.
         
         SAFE to add: SIM toolkit, system services, non-security-critical apps
         UNSAFE to add: Payment apps, banking apps, apps with root detection
